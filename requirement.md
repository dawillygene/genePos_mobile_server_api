Of course. This is an excellent project. A POS system is complex but very manageable with Flutter and SQLite. Here is a comprehensive breakdown of functional requirements (what the system *must do*) and non-functional requirements (*how* the system should perform) for your application.

I will structure it based on the two user roles: **Sales** and **Admin**.

---

### **1. Functional Requirements (Features)**

#### **A. Authentication & User Management (Admin)**
*   **FR1: Role-Based Login:** The app must allow users to log in based on their role (Sales or Admin).
*   **FR2: User Management (Admin Only):** Admin must be able to:
    *   Create, view, update, and deactivate sales user accounts.
    *   Assign a secure PIN or password to each sales user.
    *   Reset user passwords.

#### **B. Product & Inventory Management (Admin)**
*   **FR3: Category Management:** Admin must be able to:
    *   Create, edit, and archive product categories (e.g., Electronics, Clothing, Food).
    *   View a list of all categories.
*   **FR4: Product Management:** Admin must be able to:
    *   Add new products with details: Name, SKU/Barcode, Description, Category, Purchase Price, Selling Price, Image, Tax settings.
    *   Edit all product details.
    *   Archive or delete products (soft delete preferred to preserve sales history).
    *   Search and filter products by name, SKU, or category.
*   **FR5: Inventory Management:** Admin must be able to:
    *   View current stock levels for all products.
    *   Update stock quantities (e.g., after a new shipment or found damage).
    *   View a history of stock adjustments.
    *   Set and receive low-stock alerts/notifications.

#### **C. Point of Sale (POS) - Sales & Admin**
*   **FR6: Cart Management:** The user (Sales role) must be able to:
    *   Scan a product barcode or search by name to add it to the cart.
    *   Manually adjust the quantity of items in the cart.
    *   Remove items from the cart.
    *   Apply discounts (percentage or fixed amount) to the entire cart or individual items.
    *   View a running subtotal, tax, discount, and grand total.
*   **FR7: Customer Management (Optional but recommended for loans):**
    *   Select or add a quick "Walk-in Customer" for anonymous sales.
    *   **OR** Select a registered customer from a list to link the sale to them (crucial for tracking loans).
*   **FR8: Checkout & Payment Processing:** The user must be able to:
    *   Finalize the sale.
    *   Select a payment method (Cash, Mobile Money, Bank Transfer, Credit Card).
    *   Enter the amount tendered by the customer.
    *   The system must automatically calculate and display the change.
    *   Complete the sale, which saves the transaction, reduces inventory, and generates a receipt.
*   **FR9: Receipt Generation:** The system must generate a digital receipt for every sale, viewable on the screen and optionally printable via a Bluetooth printer.

#### **D. Sales & Transaction History (Admin & Sales)**
*   **FR10: Transaction List:** Users must be able to view a list of all sales transactions.
    *   **Sales Role:** Can typically only view their own transactions for the day.
    *   **Admin Role:** Can view all transactions from all users and all time.
*   **FR11: Transaction Details:** Clicking on a transaction must show the complete details: items purchased, prices, discounts, taxes, payment method, date, time, and the salesperson.
*   **FR12: Sales Reports (Admin):** Admin must be able to generate reports based on:
    *   **Sales by Date:** Daily, weekly, monthly summaries.
    *   **Sales by Product:** Top-selling products.
    *   **Sales by Category:** Performance of different categories.
    *   **Sales by Employee:** Performance of each salesperson.

#### **E. Customer Loans / Credit Management (Admin)**
*   **FR13: Customer Database:** Admin must be able to add, edit, and view customers (Name, Phone, Email, Credit Limit).
*   **FR14: Credit Sales:** During checkout, if a registered customer is selected, the option to mark the sale as "Credit" must appear.
    *   The system must check if the sale amount exceeds the customer's credit limit.
*   **FR15: Loan (Credit) Tracking:** Admin must have a dedicated section to:
    *   View all outstanding loans.
    *   See each customer's total debt.
    *   Record a payment against a customer's loan (partial or full).
    *   View a history of all credit transactions and payments for a specific customer.

#### **F. Dashboard & Statistics (Admin)**
*   **FR16: Business Overview Dashboard:** The Admin's home screen should display key metrics:
    *   Today's Total Sales Revenue.
    *   Number of Transactions today.
    *   Total Outstanding Loans.
    *   Low Stock Alerts.
    *   Charts/graphs for sales trends (e.g., last 7 days).

#### **G. Data Management (Admin)**
*   **FR17: Local Data Backup & Restore:** Admin must be able to create a backup of the entire SQLite database (e.g., to cloud storage like Google Drive) and restore from a backup file.

---

### **2. Non-Functional Requirements (Quality Attributes)**

*   **NFR1: Performance:** The application must be responsive. Key actions like adding to cart, searching products, and completing a sale must happen in less than 1-2 seconds.
*   **NFR2: Reliability & Stability:** The app must not crash, especially during the critical checkout process. Transaction data must never be lost once "Complete Sale" is pressed.
*   **NFR3: Usability:** The User Interface (UI) must be intuitive and easy to use, especially under pressure during a sale. Buttons should be large and easy to tap. The sales workflow should require minimal taps.
*   **NFR4: Offline-First Capability:** This is crucial for a POS. The app must function fully without an internet connection. All operations (sales, inventory updates) must sync locally to SQLite first. (Cloud sync can be a future enhancement).
*   **NFR5: Security:**
    *   User authentication must be secure.
    *   Sensitive data like passwords should be hashed in the database.
    *   Admin functions must be protected from access by Sales users.
*   **NFR6: Portability:** The app should run seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms (which Flutter handles perfectly).
*   **NFR7: Scalability (Data):** The SQLite database schema should be designed efficiently to handle a growing number of products, transactions, and customers without significant performance degradation.

### **Suggested SQLite Database Schema (Core Tables)**

Hereâ€™s a simplified schema to get you started:

1.  **`users`**: `id`, `username`, `pin_hash`, `role` ('admin', 'sales'), `is_active`
2.  **`categories`**: `id`, `name`, `description`
3.  **`products`**: `id`, `name`, `sku`, `description`, `category_id`, `purchase_price`, `selling_price`, `stock_quantity`, `image_path`, `is_active`
4.  **`customers`**: `id`, `name`, `phone`, `email`, `credit_limit`, `outstanding_balance`
5.  **`transactions`**: `id`, `transaction_number`, `user_id`, `customer_id` (can be NULL for walk-in), `subtotal`, `tax_amount`, `discount_amount`, `total_amount`, `amount_tendered`, `change`, `payment_method`, `is_credit` (0 for false, 1 for true), `timestamp`
6.  **`transaction_items`**: `id`, `transaction_id`, `product_id`, `quantity`, `unit_price`, `total_price`
7.  **`payments`** (for loan repayments): `id`, `customer_id`, `amount`, `payment_method`, `notes`, `timestamp`
8.  **`stock_adjustments`** (for inventory logs): `id`, `product_id`, `old_quantity`, `new_quantity`, `reason`, `user_id`, `timestamp`

### **Next Steps for Development:**

1.  **Set up your Flutter project.**
2.  **Choose an SQLite package:** `sqflite` is the most popular and stable choice for Flutter.
3.  **Database Initialization:** Write a function to create all these tables when the app is first launched.
4.  **Implement the UI:** Start by building the login screen, then the Admin Dashboard and the Sales POS interface separately based on the user role.
5.  **Focus on Core Flow First:** Build the **Product -> Cart -> Checkout -> Save Transaction** flow before moving to advanced features like reports and loans.

This list provides a solid foundation. You can start coding based on this and expand on each requirement as you go. Good luck with your project
